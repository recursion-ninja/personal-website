#### Welcome to my digital domain!

I am Alex Washburn, pseudonymously known as Recursion Ninja.

Currently, I study full-time as a computer science Masters student at [Hunter College of the City of New York][CUNY-Hunter], where I am advised by [Subash Shankar][Page-Subash].
My thesis involves applying formal methods to verify a novel secure group messaging [cryptographic protocol][DOI-TreeKEM].
I am also a research associate at the [American Museum of Natural History][AMNH-CompSci].

My primary research interests include compilers, programming language theory, formal methods, and software ergonomics.
Some ancillary research interests involve abstract algebra, artificial intelligence, number theory, cryptography, and ethics.

For my next academic endeavor, I am interested in researching the interplay between strong type systems, both linear and dependent, and compiler memory management while pursuing a PhD.
The combination of these language features allow for compile-time, [automatic memory management][DOI-Memory] under certain circumstances.
Specifically, I am interested in how [quantitative type theory][DOI-QTT] coupled with an extended [abstract machine][Wiki-AbsComp] can lead to novel compile-time memory and execution optimizations.
Additionally, I would like to explore heuristically detecting [decidable][Wiki-Halting] sub-components of a program and perform special optimizations enabled by a combination of decidability, linear, and dependent type information.
I am seeking out both an **academic advisor** capable of supporting this research, as well as **colleagues** for collaboration.
If your passions align with mine, please reach out!

You can find more information on my current and past projects, along with various contact methods, on my [curriculum vitae][WWW-To-CV].

My [blog][WWW-To-Blog] catalogs a detailed record of some of my notable undertakings.
