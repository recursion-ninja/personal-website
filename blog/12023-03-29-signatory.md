## Advocation of an Advanced A.I. Armistice

A recently published open letter titled [*"Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter"*][0] has gained attention within academic and scientific advocacy circles.
The letter concisely recounts the myriad, yet small subset of well-founded cautionary considerations accumulated and collated by humanity over more than half a century.
Upon review of the this open letter and after careful consideration, being of common concordance with the both the general thesis and having no refutations for the details within, I have elected for accession of myself as a signatory.
With the greatest sincerity, I hope that contemporary forethought yields a framework for future general A.I. development which will be a symbiotic and mutually beneficial endeavor, equitable for the totality of humanity and our posterity; both biological and synthetic.
