This website has been a long time in the making.
In fact, it has been intermittently developed and recast for throughout my life but never reaching a state which I found to be fully formed and presentable.
Cloistered away in private repositories, from time to time I would reapproach the unfinished work and achieve some partial progress towards it's state of readiness.
At each point of resumption, my expectations and impressions of the site had changed, and subsequently required additional development before contentment could be found.
Now, it is with great pride and fanfare that I find that my small creation are more than ready to emerge from the shadows  and be shared the wider world.

As I explore my interests and ambitions, it is my intention to catalog reflections on the intellectual experiences which I find notable here.
I anticipate that what is written will be of a mathematical or computational nature, with varying degrees of technicality.
It is my hope that to some small few, the blog posts written here will be academically enriching, technically insightful, or simply a joyful read.
