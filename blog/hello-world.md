These are my tentative first steps from behind the immaculate veil of privacy I have maintained since adolecence into the penumbra of the public light.
I find in moments like these it is best to reflect on what brings a person to the precipce of irreversible choice and what outcome they seek before making the daring leap.
For myself, I have walked an arduous road to reach this place in my life.

Born with a silver spoon in the mouth, my childhood could described only as idyllic.
Unsurprisingly the winds of fortune changed with age.
The magnitude of this change however, would leave me transfixed.
Late adolecence and young adulthood brought a cacophony of tribulations.
I had been rendered lame twice through unexpected injury and twice endured the exacting course to recapture full mobility.
Subsequently stricken by a rapid procession of sudden and deep personal losses, grappling with exigent anguish became my preoccupation.
This regretable confulence temporarily arrested my professional development.
After a decade quelling the misfortunes that beset me, I find myself finally capable of pursuing my ambitions.

This website has been a long time in the making.
In fact, it has been intermittently developed and recast for throughout my life but never reaching a state which I found to be fully formed and presentable.
Cloistered away in private repositories, from time to time I would reapproach the unfinished work and achieve some partial progress towards it's state of rediness.
In some way, I find that the state of my website was a ftting reflection of my own state, not yet presentable or in a state of rediness, requiring additional development before contentment could be found.
Now, with great pride and fanfare I find that both myself and by small creation are more than ready to emerge from a cloistered state and be shared the wider world.

As I explore my intrests and ambitions, it is my intention to catalog reflections on the intellectual experiences which I find notable here.
I anticipate that what is written will be of a mathematical or computational nature, with varying degrees of technicality.
It is my hope that to some small few, the blog posts written here will be academically enriching, technically insightful, or simply a joyful read.
