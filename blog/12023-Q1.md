## Quarter 1: Winter Solstice to Vernal Equinox


### Doctoral Program

Infrastructure for program synthesis


### TreeKEM Formal Verification

Final scaling characteristics


### Project Euler

Some of my peers have been utilizing Project Euler as a set of sample problems to solve while learning new languages.
I have used this opportunity to dive back in and continue my progression by particiapating with them.
Interestingly, they have not chosen the easier problems from the beginning of the archive.
Rather, they have select problems from the 200 range.
The combinatorics required to solve [Problem 205][p205] was a refreshing experience in recurrence relations and dynamic programming.
Similarly, when solving [Problem 206][p206] I appreciated applying number theory to prune the search space rather than employing brute force search.


### AMNH Research Associate

Submitted a manuscript for publication.

Second manuscript in the works.

Performance tuning Haskell.
