#### Welcome to my digital domain!

I am Alex Washburn, pseudonymously known as Recursion Ninja.

Currently, I study full-time as a computer science Masters student at [Hunter College of the City of New York](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/csci/computer-science-masters), where I am advised by [Subash Shankar](https://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sshankar).
My thesis involves applying formal methods to verify a novel secure group messaging [cryptographic protocol](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56784-2_9).
I am also a research associate at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/research/computational-sciences).

My primary research interests include compilers, programming language theory, formal methods, and software ergonomics.
Some ancillary research interests involve abstract algebra, number theory, cryptography, ethics, and artificial intelligence.

For my next academic endeavor, I intend to explore the interplay between strong type stystems, both linear and dependent, and total functional programming's impact on memory management while pursuing a PhD.
The combination of these language features allow for compile-time, [automatic memory management under memory](https://doi.org/10.1145/292540.292564) circumstances.
Specifically, I am interested in how [quantitative type theory](https://doi.org/10.1145/3209108.3209189) coupled with a [decidable language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_language) can lead to novel compile-time memory and execution optimiztions.
I am seeking out both an **academic advisor** capable of supporting this reaserch, as well as **colleagues** for collaboration.
If your passions align with mine, please reach out!
